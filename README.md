# Sternhalma AI

This project aims to implement the AlphaZero algorithm from scratch to master the game of **Sternhalma** (commonly known as Chinese Checkers).

The game logic is implemented in the `sternhalma-game` crate, and the Python bindings are implemented in the `sternhalma-python` crate.

## Project Structure

- `sternhalma-game`: The game logic.
- `sternhalma-python`: Python bindings for the game logic.
- `sternhalma-agent`: The AlphaZero agent.
- `sternhalma-server`: The server that handles the game state and communication.
