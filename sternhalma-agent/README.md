# Sternhalma Agent

This project aims to implement the AlphaZero algorithm from scratch to master the game of **Sternhalma** (commonly known as Chinese Checkers).

The game logic is implemented in the `sternhalma-game` crate, and the Python bindings are implemented in the `sternhalma-python` crate.
